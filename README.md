## Background

As part of our course, we were given a choice to select a dataset and run visualization with following instruction

1) Select a dataset of your own choice (simple, complicated, whatever your level of comfort is.

2) Chop the dataset using pandas to fit whatever visualization you have in mind.

3) Clean the dataset and drop missing values - if needed

4) Create two different types of visualization - minimum. Your choice, just make sure they are different kinds - (for example a bar chart and a pie, but not two pies).

5) You can have more visualizations if you want

6) Make sure your readme file is perfect!

7) Submit on github and kaggle (if using kaggle datasets), just github if you are using data from other sources like drivedata.org or other census data.

I selected video game sales to investigate which type of Genre is most sold and also furhter investigate the number of sales varaition through years.

## Project Explaination

In this p[roject we follwo below steps

1. We install all the required library in Anaconda
2. Import the vgsales csv file
3. Check for any NA/NaN and remove them
4. Using Matplotlib to plot barplot comparing
> Genre and number of sales
> Year and number of sales
5. Using Matplotlib to plot pie chart comparing
> Genre and number of sales
> Platform and number of sales
6. Using Matplotlib to plot boxplot comparing genre and number of sales
7. Using Matplotlib to plot area chart comparing Platform and number of sales
8. Using Matplotlib to plot kde comparing genre and number of sales
