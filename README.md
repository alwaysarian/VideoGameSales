## Background

As part of our course, we were given a choice to select a dataset and run visualization with following instruction

1) Select a dataset of your own choice (simple, complicated, whatever your level of comfort is.

2) Chop the dataset using pandas to fit whatever visualization you have in mind.

3) Clean the dataset and drop missing values - if needed

4) Create two different types of visualization - minimum. Your choice, just make sure they are different kinds - (for example a bar chart and a pie, but not two pies).

5) You can have more visualizations if you want

6) Make sure your readme file is perfect!

7) Submit on github and kaggle (if using kaggle datasets), just github if you are using data from other sources like drivedata.org or other census data.

I selected video game sales to investigate which type of Genre is most sold and also furhter investigate the number of sales varaition through years.
